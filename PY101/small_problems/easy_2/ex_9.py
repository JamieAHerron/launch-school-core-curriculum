# Build a program that randomly generates and prints Teddy's age. To get the age, you should generate a random number between 20 and 100, inclusive.

# Teddy is 69 years old!

import random

print(f'Teddy is {random.randint(20, 100)} years old!')

#What is the difference between randrange and randint? 

#Further Exploration
# Modify this program to ask for a name, then print the age for that person. For an extra challenge, use "Teddy" as the name if no name is entered.
